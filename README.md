# World_Weather_analysis

## Overview
Our goal was to create a tool for PlanMyTrip app to perform real time weather data analysis for various loactions around the world. This function would help clients make informed decisions about their travel plans based on the conditions they desire for their travel. In order to make it user friendly we paired it with familiar google maps attributes that display the city, hotel name, current weather conditions and max temperature. 

## Results
We built a user interface that is interactive and expansive, with data points across the eitire world for the user to expolore.
